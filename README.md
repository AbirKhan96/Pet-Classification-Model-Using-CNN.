# Pet-Classification-Model-Using-CNN.
DESCRIPTION  Build a CNN model that classifies the given pet images correctly into dog and cat images.   The project scope document specifies the requirements for the project “Pet Classification Model Using CNN.” Apart from specifying the functional and nonfunctional requirements for the project, it also serves as an input for project scoping.   Project Description and Scope   You are provided with the following resources that can be used as inputs for your model:   1. A collection of images of pets, that is, cats and dogs. These images are of   different sizes with varied lighting conditions. 2. Code template containing the following code blocks:   a. Import modules (part 1) b. Set hyper parameters (part 2) c. Read image data set (part 3) d. Run TensorFlow model (part 4)   You are expected to write the code for CNN image classification model (between Parts 3 and 4) using TensorFlow that trains on the data and calculates the accuracy score on the test data.
